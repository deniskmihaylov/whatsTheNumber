# whatsTheNumber
A project included in my education in SoftUni. The game ''Guess The Number'' can guess the opponents ''the computer'' chooses a random number between 1 and 100  and the user must guess it. After each number the user enters, the computer will give a hint of whether the number is lower or greater.
